\subsection{Performance of Software \instructions{(Maximum 2 pages)}}
\label{sec:performance}

\subsubsection{Testing of your code on the requested machine}
\label{sec:testing}

\instructions{\it
  
  It is strongly recommended that your production code is tested in the requested machine(s) (see also the text referring to Benchmark Access in the Important Notice at the top of page 1).
  Please specify the EuroHPC Benchmark Access project (if any) or other projects (previous PRACE Calls, national calls, etc.) used to prepare the Regular Access proposal.
  If the preparatory host machine is different from the target machine, specify why you think the data is relevant.
  In the latter case, please report briefly the conversion factor (in terms of ratio of time to solution, flops or requested node hours) from the machine where the preparatory tests were performed to the requested system.
  Moreover, your proposal must account for all technical constraints and requirements of the targeted machine(s) as documented in the separate Technical Guidelines for Applicants document; failing to do so will significantly increase the risk that your project will be technically rejected.

}

\subsubsection{Quantify the HPC performance of your project}

\instructions{\it

  The presented data must be representative of the entire workflow of the project proposed and refer to the main application code you intend for the production work.
  The software scalability data (see Examples of \textbf{Performance Reporting} below) must be used to choose the most efficient job size(s) for the simulations planned in production: the corresponding software performance must be clearly linked to the justification of the computing resources requested.
  The Domain Panels will not accept estimates based on related codes and/or data related to parts of your production.
  All data must refer to the targeted systems in your production runs or a system with comparable size, software stack and with the same architecture, and network (e.g. a project can be accepted on MeluXina GPU if it was benchmarked on another GPU machine with the same NVIDIA A100 GPU).
  Please coordinate with the centres if in doubt about the portability of your code.
  Specify that performance results are reported on the basis of one of the following: whole application including I/O; whole application except I/O; kernel only; other (specify).
  More specifically you must include:

}

\paragraph{Strong and weak scalability}
\label{sec:scaling}
\instructions{\it

  Starting with the minimum size of the computer necessary to run the problem (usually 1 core or 1 node).
  Justify the minimum size for your scaling if it is larger than 1 core or 1 node (e.g. memory limitations).
  Please provide a justification in case that either the weak (e.g. study of one particular bio-molecule) or the strong (e.g. study of an ensemble) scalability metric is not considered relevant to your project.
  See \textbf{Examples of Performance Reporting} below for the requested format.

}

% <Enter your text here>

\instructions{\it

  \textbf{Examples of Performance Reporting.}
  For the weak and strong scaling please start with the minimum and finish with the maximum number of nodes that are suitable for your application.
  Please mark the number of nodes that you expect to perform the main load of your work.
  On the Y axis you may use time to solution (scaled or otherwise) or speedup with respect to the minimum number of cores.
  \textbf{\textcolor{orange}{The table with the timings is mandatory}}.

  The table should include the speedup and the parallel efficiency.
  Log/log plots are useful to span many orders of magnitude.

}

\paragraph{Precision reported}
\instructions{\it

  One of: single precision, double precision, mixed precision.
  Only the precision you use in the simulation is relevant.

}

\paragraph{Time-to-solution}

\instructions{\it

  The normalized time-to-solution averaged per iteration

  \[
  T^*_i = \frac{t_i\cdot N_c}{N_e}
  \]

  AND the normalized total time to solution

  \[
  T_f^* = \frac{t_f\cdot N_c}{N_e}
  \]

  with $t_i$ the time per iteration, $t_f$ the total time to solution, $N_c$ the number of cores and $N_e$ the number of computational
  elements (size of the problem).

  IMPORTANT: Justify the choice of your code (e.g., comparison with existing codes, methods or any other scientifically rigorous argumentation). 
  See also the text referring to Preparatory Access in the Important Notice at the top of Page 1.

}

\paragraph{System scale}

\instructions{ \it

  One of: results measured on full-scale system, projected from results of smaller system, other (specify).

}

\paragraph{Measurement mechanism}

\instructions{ \it

  One of: timers, FLOP count, static analysis tool, performance modelling, other (specify).

}

\paragraph{Memory usage}

\instructions{ \it

  Specify requirements per node or core depending on the size of the problem.

}

\paragraph{OPTIONAL: Percentage of available peak performance}

\instructions{ \it

  Please collaborate with the Centre on obtaining this information (see also the text referring to Preparatory Access in the Important Notice at the top of Page 1).
  Alternatively provide code specific metrics for the requested machine (FLOPS, etc.).

}

\section{Milestones (quarterly basis) \instructions{(Maximum 1 page)}}
\label{sec:milestones}
\instructions{\it

  Goals and milestones should articulate simulation and developmental objectives and be sufficiently detailed to assess the progress of the project for each year of any allocation granted.
  It is especially important that you provide clear connections between the project's overarching milestones, the planned production simulations, and the compute time expected to be required for these simulations.
  Please clarify any dependencies of milestones on other milestones.
  Please ensure that the node hour consumption is regular throughout the allocation or provide a requested schedule after consultation with the centres.

}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \small
    \caption{Breakdown of the types of runs proposed and the resources requested. The number of nodes and the time per step are taken from Table~\ref{tab:timings}. We report about two types of runs, ISO and LIBE, for which we refer to Table~\ref{table:ensembles} for an overview. Comparing the two tables, the number of runs is equivalent to the number of configurations to be analyzed, and the number of steps is equivalent to the number of sources to be computed divided by one hundred since the time per step is defined as the time needed for computing one hundred sources. In the case of the ISO run type, the sources are used for computing connected light, strange and charm contributions. In the case of LIBE runs the sources are used for computing three slopes, two in the (twisted Wilson) quark mass parameters $\kappa$ and $\mu$, and one in $\alpha_{em}$, for connected and disconnected contributions and for the three quark flavors. This motivates the larger number of sources required. }
